Our project consists of creating this webpage which will help librarians to manage their books better. 
All the books will be added by the admin in the webpage, and they will have detailed information about the authors, number of pages, the version and so on. 
Admin will have fullauthorization and access to the webpage and can add or even delete books and users; in case they can be lost at some point of the time.
Other than information above, these books will have an option for the users available.
